# Sergeant API

A stupidly simple GraphQL API exploration. (Currently) just two small JSON files. This is meant to be the growing backend of a simple ReactNative app to guide me sequentially through a morning routing.

## TODO

- [ ] Move data to a database -- probably Mongoose, just to try it out
- [ ] Allow for mutations to Drills' steps (add, remove, reorder)
- [ ] Create user model
- [ ] Explore authentication/authorization/security

But for now, this is just a fun way to explore GraphQL, which seems pretty sweet.
